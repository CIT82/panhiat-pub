# Daily Morning Routine with My Kids

I enjoy waking up at 7 A.M.

- [ ] Do a load of laundry
- [ ] 20-minute workout


At 8 A.M. I prepare my kids' breakfast.

5. Orange juice or apple juice

Around 9 A.M. we *focus* on my toddler's language and communication skills:

- Colors
- Shapes
- Alphabets
- Numbers

At 12 P.M. it's recess time in the backyard with the kids.
